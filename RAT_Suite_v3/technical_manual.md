# HPMS Roadway Alignment Tool (RAT) Suite v3
**Technical Manual (Detailed Practitioner Edition)**

## Executive Summary
The HPMS Roadway Alignment Tool (RAT) Suite v3 is a production-oriented geospatial analytics system that derives roadway alignment intelligence from HPMS geometry and elevation data. It is designed for statewide scale while still supporting route-level engineering review. 

The suite provides three operational capabilities:
* Network-wide alignment analytics (horizontal and vertical curve detection and severity classification)
* Route-level Plan & Profile generation (engineering-style visual review artifacts)
* 4D enrichment (Z/M-enabled geometry for GIS/CAD/3D downstream use)

The current RAT version was developed to address a practical challenge common to DOT datasets: HPMS roadway geometry is often fragmented, noisy, and inconsistent across jurisdictions and functional classes. The suite is therefore designed to be resilient to disjointed geometry and schema variability, while maintaining transparent analytical methods and repeatable outputs.

## 1. Overview
The HPMS Roadway Alignment Tool (RAT) Suite is an enterprise geospatial processing pipeline for deriving roadway alignment intelligence from HPMS geometry. It is designed to process fragmented roadway networks at scale, detect horizontal and vertical curves, generate plan/profile engineering sheets, and produce 4D-enriched geometry suitable for downstream workflows.

Unlike a design-authoring system, RAT is an **analytical derivation tool**: it estimates curve attributes from observed geometry and elevation data.

## 2. What Changed in This Version and Why It Matters
Version 3 moves from "multiple independently evolving tools" to a unified architecture with a shared core engine and a single orchestrating GUI. 

### 2.1 Architectural & Computational Efficiencies
To process tens of thousands of fragmented routes at a statewide scale, the RAT Suite architecture introduces several critical computer science optimizations that drastically reduce processing time and hardware strain.

* **Subprocess Memory Isolation (Bypassing the GIL):** Python is historically limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and struggles to release memory when processing massive DataFrames. This version solves this by completely decoupling the interface from the math. The Unified GUI acts only as a lightweight dispatcher that triggers the CLI modules in temporary, isolated memory environments. Once a batch finishes processing, that memory block is immediately dumped, eliminating memory-leak crashes.
* **Algorithmic Time Complexity (cKDTree Spatial Indexing):** In the 4D Enricher, mapping thousands of fragmented 2D vertices to a continuous 3D elevation profile requires massive data correlation. The current version utilizes a Metric `cKDTree` (a highly optimized spatial indexing algorithm). This organizes the geometry into a mathematical search tree, dropping the search time complexity and instantly snapping coordinates to their nearest 3D neighbor.
* **Unified Analytical Core (Compute-Once Architecture):** The current version routes all modules through a single, shared analytical core (`rat_core.py`). A route's raw geometry is projected to a flat UTM plane, densified, and smoothed via splines exactly once, cutting required processing overhead in half.
* **Contiguous Block Grouping (Context-Aware Processing):** A single HPMS route can cross city limits or change functional classes multiple times. The current version introduces a cumsum() block-identification algorithm that dynamically chops routes into contiguous segments whenever the UrbanID or FSystem changes. This allows the engine to apply distinct stiffness factors to rural highways versus urban grids on the fly, without accidentally stitching separated urban chunks together and destroying the continuous alignment.

## 3. Suite Components

### 3.1 Unified GUI (`rat_unified_gui.py`)
The GUI is the orchestrating command center. It does not perform heavy geometry math directly; instead, it gathers inputs, writes a `run_params.json` payload, and launches CLI modules in isolated subprocesses. By passing the parameters as a JSON payload to a disconnected subprocess, the suite strictly isolates the massive memory arrays required to process statewide datasets from the user interface.

### 3.2 Mathematical & Geospatial Core (`rat_core.py`)
This is the central processing brain of the suite. It contains zero GUI or plotting code. It manages the dynamic reprojection of WGS84 coordinates into localized, flat UTM zones for highly accurate distance calculations. It houses the `UnivariateSpline` decoupling logic, the calculus-based horizontal curvature extraction, and the vertical parabolic polynomial regression models.

### 3.3 Master Alignment CLI (`rat_alignment_cli.py`)
The bulk processing orchestrator for network-wide analytics. It feeds fragmented geometries into the Core engine, compiles horizontal and vertical curve dictionaries into master Pandas DataFrames, and serializes these arrays into standard CSVs and spatial formats (GeoJSON, GPKG, SHP).

### 3.4 Plan & Profile CLI + PDF Renderer
This two-part module generates highly detailed, route-specific engineering artifacts.
* **`rat_plan_profile_cli.py`:** Mathematically tracks cumulative linear distance across disjointed physical gaps in the HPMS geometry, ensuring heavily fragmented routes plot continuously.
* **`rat_plan_profile_report_pdf.py`:** Uses the pre-processed elevation data to graph the vertical profile, and queries live REST endpoints for USGS aerial basemaps, dynamically applying affine rotation matrices to ensure the roadway geometry always flows horizontally across the final PDF sheet.

### 3.5 4D Enricher (`hpms_4d_enricher_cli.py`)
The topology generation module. It upgrades flat 2D linework into 3D/4D spatial geometries (`LINESTRING ZM`). It uses a highly optimized `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` index to snap fragmented raw 2D vertices back to the mathematically perfected 3D elevation profile generated by the core.

### 3.6 Validator (`rat_results_validator.py`)
The automated QA/QC inspector. It programmatically scans generated outputs before production delivery, checking for mathematical impossibilities (e.g., negative curve lengths) and validating severity bin categorical integrity.

---

## 4. Input Data and File Handling

### 4.1 FHWA Socrata API (Automated)
The easiest way to process a state is to pull directly from the FHWA full 2024 HPMS Socrata database.
* **Target State FIPS Code:** Enter the 2-digit state FIPS code (e.g., 06 for California).
* **Functional System Filters:** Target specific F-Systems (e.g., 1 for Interstate only).

### 4.2 Local HPMS Files (.shp, .geojson, .csv)
If your state has internally modified HPMS data, you can process local files using the Use Local HPMS File option.
* **On-the-Fly Auto-Reprojection:** If your local shapefile is saved in a custom Coordinate Reference System (CRS), the engine will automatically reproject the data to WGS84 in memory.
* **"Fuzzy Matching" Attribute Columns:** The engine uses a fuzzy-matching dictionary to read your attribute table. The following variables map directly to the FHWA Socrata file requirements: `line`, `route_id`, `begin_point`, `end_point`, `f_system`, and `urban_id`.

## 5. Core Geometric and Analytical Methods (Detailed)

### 5.1 The "Jagged GPS" Problem: Spline Smoothing
* **The Issue:** Raw roadway geometry in HPMS is often digitized by clicking points on a screen. If the model tried to calculate the radius of a curve using raw data, the math would interpret every tiny zigzag between GPS points as a separate hairpin turn.
* **The Solution (Decoupled Splines):** The RAT engine mathematically "irons out" the road using a Spline. It "decouples" the horizontal (X, Y) and vertical (Z) smoothing, meaning it can aggressively iron out GPS jitters side-to-side without flattening out a legitimate hill.

### 5.2 The "North Crossing" Problem: Deflection Angle (Delta) Unwrapping
* **The Issue:** While the current RAT engine uses calculus to calculate the radius of a curve, it must still look at the compass heading to calculate the Total Deflection Angle (Delta). If a road curving gently to the right crosses true North, its heading instantly jumps from 359° back to 1°, creating a false 358-degree deflection angle.
* **The Solution (Unwrapped Headings):** The engine uses "unwrapping." Instead of resetting at 360°, the math allows the compass to keep counting upward (e.g., 358°, 359°, 360°, 361°), calculating a perfectly accurate deflection angle.

### 5.3 The "River Dip" Problem: Topo Draping and Bridging
* **The Issue:** The RAT Suite generates vertical data by "draping" it over a 3D USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM). However, DEMs represent "bare earth." When a highway crosses a bridge, the bare earth drops away. 
* **The Solution (Core Bridging & KDTree Mapping):**
  1. **Core Bridging (`rat_core.py`):** The core engine performs a "Valley Test." If the ground suddenly drops far below the topographic trendline (triggered by the `DIP_THRESHOLD_FT` deviation), the engine mathematically suspends the road in the air, interpolating a smooth bridge. Because this mathematical repair occurs centrally, all downstream modules automatically benefit.
  2. **4D KDTree Mapping (`hpms_4d_enricher_cli.py`):** The 4D Enricher uses a "Macro KDTree" to spatially index the perfect, bridged 3D profile generated by the core, and snaps fragmented 2D highway segments up onto that continuous profile.

### 5.4 Finding the Start and End Points: The "Steering Wheel" Concept
* **Horizontal:** The algorithm calculates the road's compass heading at user-defined intervals (default 10 feet). If the heading changes by more than the `H_MIN_HEAD_CHANGE` threshold, it drops a "Start RP" pin.
* **Vertical:** The algorithm looks at the uphill/downhill slope (Grade). When the slope starts bending, it drops the "Start RP" (PVC).

### 5.5 Calculating the Curve Geometrics
* **Horizontal:** It calculates mathematically perfect Radius using the circular arc formula: `R = (180 × Length) / (π × Δ)`.
* **Vertical:** It uses linear regression to measure the straight road leading into the curve (G1) and out of it (G2). It subtracts these to find the Algebraic Difference (A), and divides the Length by A to find the K-Value.

### 5.6 The "Diluted Average" Problem: Minimum Apex Radius
* **The Issue:** Real-world roads have spiral transitions. If the engine only calculates average radius, flat entry/exit transitions will dilute the curve's severity.
* **The Solution (Instantaneous Apex Radius):** The engine calculates instantaneous curvature at every 10-foot interval. It isolates the single highest curvature value to calculate the `Min_Radius_m` (Apex Radius). Severity Bins (A-F) are based exclusively on this sharpest apex.

### 5.7 Preserving the Ground Truth: LRS Proportional Calibration
* **The Solution:** After mathematical smoothing, the line becomes physically shorter. The engine calculates what percentage of the way along the smoothed line a curve exists, and maps those exact percentages back onto the original `Start_MP` and `End_MP` boundaries.

### 5.8 Directionality, Grades, and S-Curves
* **Horizontal Left vs. Right:** If the deflection angle from Point of Curvature to Point of Tangent is positive, it is a "Right" curve.
* **Compound and Reverse (S-Curves):** **If the user toggles the "Enable Merging" parameter**, the engine evaluates the `MERGE_GAP_FT` and fuses adjacent curves of the same direction. If disabled, curves are kept separate. S-Curves are always kept separate to preserve the inflection point.

### 5.9 Savitzky-Golay Buffer (+2 requirement)
The requirement of adding exactly two points beyond the `H_BASE_SMOOTH_WINDOW` is a strict mathematical constraint of the Savitzky-Golay filter (`scipy.signal`). It guarantees that even fragmented road segments possess enough coordinates to satisfy the mathematical requirement without crashing.

### 5.10 Calculus-Based Curvature (Horizontal Analysis)
The engine (`rat_core.py`) calculates the first and second gradients (derivatives) with respect to the spacing interval. The instantaneous curvature (κ) is calculated, allowing the engine to calculate a mathematically perfect radius (R = 1/κ) for every meter of the road.

### 5.11 Vertical Parabolic Fitting (Vertical Analysis)
The engine applies a second-degree polynomial regression (`numpy.polyfit`) to fit a true mathematical parabola. It derives the exact tangent slopes (Grades) at the precise Point of Vertical Curvature (PVC) and Point of Vertical Tangency (PVT) using the first derivative.

### 5.12 The "City Grid" Problem: Rural vs. Urban Bifurcation
* **The Issue:** Urban alignments are heavily constrained by right-of-way, intersections, and lower design speeds, meaning they inherently feature tighter, more abrupt geometry than sweeping rural highways. Applying a massive 4500 smoothing factor to an urban route will mathematically "wash out" legitimate city blocks, while applying a 100 factor to a rural route leaves too much micro-noise.

* **The Solution:** (The 2x4 Stiffness Matrix): The RAT Suite categorizes every coordinate using the HPMS UrbanID field (where 99999 is Rural, and all others are Urban). The core engine applies a 2x4 matrix of parameters based on Context (Rural/Urban) and Functional System.

* **Bifurcated Thresholds:** Because urban curves (like channelized slip lanes) and urban vertical profile shifts (like ramping up to a railway) are physically shorter and more abrupt than rural features, the engine also bifurcates the minimum detection thresholds. For example, the engine looks for minimum horizontal curve lengths of 100 feet in rural areas, but drops that requirement to 50 feet in urban areas to capture legitimate intersection movements.

## 6. Units of Measurement – Metric Core
When configuring parameters and analyzing the output data, you will notice a mix of Metric (meters) and Imperial (feet/miles) units. This hybrid approach is intentional, designed to merge strict geospatial standards with standard US highway engineering practices.

### 6.1 The Metric Core
Under the hood, standard geographic information systems (GIS) and planar projections like UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) natively operate using meters. When the RAT Suite processes a route, it temporarily projects the WGS84 Latitude/Longitude coordinates into a flat UTM plane to perform highly accurate distance and curvature math. Because the underlying Python spatial libraries (`shapely`, `scipy`, `pyproj`) expect metric inputs for these planar projections, all internal mathematics—including spline smoothing, curve radii calculations, and spatial distance checks—are executed strictly in meters. Keeping the core engine entirely metric prevents the compounding rounding errors that occur when constantly converting back and forth during heavy computations.

### 6.2 Imperial Units "On the Edges"
While the engine computes in metric, the suite is built to interact with users using standard US Imperial units "on the edges" (the inputs and outputs):
* **Inputs:** HPMS route measures (`Begin_Point` and `End_Point`) are always read and processed as Miles. All of the user-facing tuning parameters, such as the `MERGE_GAP_FT` or `V_MIN_OFFSET_FT`, are defined in feet so analysts can configure the tool using familiar highway engineering thresholds.
* **Outputs:** The Plan & Profile Generator automatically converts the metric geometry at the very end of the process to draw classic 100-foot stationing labels on the PDFs. Vertical curve K-Values and Algebraic Grade Differences are calculated to align with standard percentage and Imperial expectations. The scripts utilize hardcoded, high-precision conversion constants to seamlessly translate between the user’s Imperial inputs and the engine's Metric core.

The validator (`rat_results_validator.py`) checks for both hard failures and warning-level anomalies.

* **Required checks (fail conditions):**
  * Required columns present

## 10. Deep Dive into Output Columns and Deliverables
This chapter explains what the outputs mean, how to interpret them, and how to use them in workflows. It distinguishes between **core engineering indicators** (used for analysis decisions) and **diagnostic/support fields** (used for QA and context).

### 10.1 Alignment Outputs (Network-Scale)
The Alignment module produces route-wide horizontal and vertical curve datasets. Primary artifacts are `Alignment_horizontal_<timestamp>.csv` and `Alignment_vertical_<timestamp>.csv`. 

### 10.2 Universal Fields You Will See Often
* **`RouteId`:** Route identifier from source dataset after normalization.
* **`Start_Dist` / `End_Dist`:** Curve start/end positions along the processed route axis. *Note: These are expressed in meters, as they represent the internal metric geometric extent used for QA checks.*
* **`Length_m`:** Computed curve length in meters.
* **`Calibrated_Start_MP` / `Calibrated_End_MP`:** Reference point calibrated start/end values mapped back from chunk-relative distance.
* **`Part`:** Indicates disjoint route chunk index when route geometry is fragmented.

### 10.3 Horizontal Curve Output Fields
* **`Radius_m`:** Representative radius estimate for the detected curve segment.
* **`Min_Radius_m`:** Sharpest local radius along the segment (apex behavior).
* **`Delta`:** Deflection angle across curve span (degrees).
* **`Dir`:** Direction relative to route digitization (`Left` or `Right`).
* **`Bin`:** Severity class (A–F), derived from curvature/radius classification logic.
* **`Merge_Status`:** `Simple` or `Compound`, depending on whether merge logic combined adjacent spans.

> **Interpretation Note:** High Delta combined with low `Radius_m` generally indicates sharper, more operationally significant curves. `Bin` is categorical, not design speed. Direction depends on original digitization direction.

### 10.4 Vertical Curve Output Fields
* **`Grade_In` / `Grade_Out`:** Estimated incoming and outgoing grades (%).
* **`Alg_Diff`:** Algebraic grade difference (signed).
* **`K_Value`:** Approximate K-value.
* **`Type`:** `CREST` or `SAG`.
* **`E`:** Vertical offset metric used in significance filtering logic.
* **`Grade_Bin`:** Severity classification (A–F) based on grade-change magnitude logic.

> **Interpretation Note:** Higher absolute `Alg_Diff` generally indicates a stronger vertical transition. K_Value interpretation depends on context (route class, speed environment, terrain).

### 10.5 Plan/Profile Vertices Output
* **`Milepost`:** The calibrated linear referencing (LRS) measure interpolated across the selected route/chunk bounds.
* **`Dist_Ft`:** Continuous distance axis in feet for plotting.
* **`Lon` / `Lat`:** Smoothed coordinate output (WGS84).
* **`Elev_Ft`:** Smoothed elevation profile (feet).
* **`Raw_Lon` / `Raw_Lat`:** Raw (pre-smoothed) coordinate reference.
* **`Elev_Raw_Ft`:** Raw DEM-based elevation before full profile smoothing.

### 10.6 Plan/Profile PDF Content Interpretation
The PDF renderer (`rat_plan_profile_report_pdf.py`) overlays analytical results onto engineering-style sheets. Use the PDF output for verifying the results from the Alignment process or for route-level engineering screening where visual cross-checking is required.

### 10.7 4D Enrichment Outputs (Z/M-Enabled Geometry)
The 4D module generates geometry with elevation (Z) and measure (M) semantics. `WKT_ZM` is the most portable serialized artifact for downstream parsing. Blender/CAD workflows generally perform better with projected metric geometry (hence the dedicated SHP export path).

### 10.8 Interactive HTML Map & Dashboard
The HTML map provides a fast QA/communication layer, ideal for quick statewide pattern scans and stakeholder visualization. The Dashboard provides summary charts for executive/management briefing snapshots and quick quality pulses.

### 10.9 QA Exceptions Output
Treat the QA Exception export as a triage list to investigate clusters and distinguish data-quality issues from parameter-induced artifacts.
* **`FAIL`:** Required integrity checks failed.
* **`PASS with warnings`:** Required checks pass, but warning-level anomalies exist.
* **`PASS clean`:** Required checks pass with no warning indicators.

---

## 11. Data and Algorithmic Anomalies
Because the RAT Suite applies strict mathematical models to highly variable, human-digitized HPMS inputs, certain geometric digitization practices will predictably trigger algorithmic anomalies. 

### 11.1 Orthogonal "Stair-Step" Digitization
* **The Anomaly:** Digitizers occasionally draw curved local roads using abrupt, 90-degree orthogonal clicks.
* **Algorithmic Response:** The engine may interpret severe stair-steps as a series of alternating left/right reverse curves rather than a single sweeping arc.
* **Analytical Mitigation:** Significantly lower the `H_SMOOTH_FACTOR` (e.g., to 500) to allow the spline maximum flexibility, or rely on the `MERGE_GAP_FT` logic to fuse the resulting micro-curves.

### 11.2 GPS Multipath Jitter and "Micro-Curves"
* **The Anomaly:** Mobile data collection rigs driving through dense urban canyons frequently experience GPS multipath errors, resulting in linework that visually "vibrates".
* **Algorithmic Response:** The second derivative of a vibrating line will trigger dozens of microscopic, high-severity (Class F) false-positive curves.
* **Analytical Mitigation:** Increase `H_SMOOTH_FACTOR` if an output dataset contains an improbable density of curves under 30 meters.

### 11.3 LiDAR Water-Body Artifacts (False Valleys)
* **The Anomaly:** DEM artifacts over large bodies of water where LiDAR pulses were scattered create artificial, deep "pits" in the bare-earth model.
* **Algorithmic Response:** If the artificial pit exceeds the `BRIDGE_MAX_LEN_FT`, the engine mathematically plunges the roadway profile into the water.
* **Analytical Mitigation:** Increase the `TREND_WINDOW_FT` to ensure the trendline remains anchored to the shorelines rather than the water surface.

### 11.4 Collinear Redundancy
* **The Anomaly:** Some datasets feature hundreds of vertices densely packed along a perfectly straight line.
* **Algorithmic Response:** The denominator of the curvature equation approaches zero, risking a "Divide by Zero" crash.
* **Analytical Mitigation:** The RAT Core utilizes a strictly constrained `densify_coords_line` function that redistributes vertices at mathematically guaranteed intervals, sanitizing collinear redundancies.

### 11.5 The "Overpass Z-Spike" (False Crests)
* **The Anomaly:** Exceptionally wide overpasses are occasionally misinterpreted by the LiDAR classification algorithm as solid ground. Raw elevation data will violently spike upward by 20 to 50 feet.
* **Algorithmic Response:** The engine will attempt to fit an extremely sharp, high-severity CREST curve to the spike.
* **Analytical Mitigation:** Increase the `V_SMOOTH_FACTOR`. This stiffer tension forces the spline to "punch straight through" the artificial DEM artifact, ignoring the overpass entirely.

  * Rural: 0.5 %
  * Urban: 1.0 %

### A.8 Practical Parameter Tuning Guidance
While the default parameters are calibrated for a general statewide run, varying topographies and digitization practices may require tuning. Use the following guide to troubleshoot and adjust the engine's behavior.

#### 1. Horizontal Smoothing (`H_SMOOTH_FACTOR`)
* **What it does:** Acts as the "tension" of the mathematical spline. Higher numbers pull the line tighter and stiffer; lower numbers allow it to flex and bend more easily.
* **Increase when:** Your outputs show an impossibly high density of tiny, high-severity horizontal curves (e.g., 50 curves in a single mile). This usually indicates the raw data has "GPS Jitter" (multipath errors) or "Stair-stepping," and the spline needs more stiffness to iron those vibrations out.
* **Decrease when:** Legitimate, tight geometry (like cloverleaf interchange ramps, roundabouts, or sharp mountain switchbacks) is being flattened out and skipped by the engine.

#### 2. Deflection and Length Thresholds (`H_MIN_DELTA` & `H_MIN_CURVE_LENGTH_FT`)
* **What they do:** They act as the "significance filters." They tell the engine to ignore curves that are too gentle or too short to matter for safety analytics.
* **Increase when:** The tool is flagging miles-long, sweeping interstate bends as curves, or catching minor lane-shifts and digitization drifts. Bumping the Delta to 5.0° or the Length to 200ft will filter these out.
* **Decrease when:** You are specifically analyzing low-speed, local functional class roads where minor deflections or short geometric shifts are actually safety-critical.

#### 3. Vertical Bridging (`TREND_WINDOW_FT` & `DIP_THRESHOLD_FT`)
* **What they do:** They control the "Valley Test." The trend window establishes the baseline earth slope, and the dip threshold determines how far the road is allowed to drop below that baseline before the bridge engages.
* **Increase `TREND_WINDOW_FT` when:** A valley is so massively wide (like the Mississippi River floodplain) that a small trend window gets dragged down into the valley with the road. A larger window forces the algorithm to anchor onto the distant shorelines.
* **Decrease `DIP_THRESHOLD_FT` when:** The engine is failing to bridge over small, shallow creeks or minor box culverts. Dropping the threshold from 6.5ft to 3.0ft makes the bridging trigger much more sensitive.

#### 4. The "Overpass Spike" (`V_SMOOTH_FACTOR`)
* **What it does:** The vertical equivalent to the horizontal tension. 
* **Increase when:** You see massive 10-to-30-foot upward spikes in your Profile View PDFs or Vertical CSVs. The bridging logic only fixes *drops* in the earth; it cannot fix LiDAR bouncing off massive highway overpasses. By increasing `V_SMOOTH_FACTOR`, you give the vertical spline enough stiffness to punch straight through the artificial overpass spike.

### A.9 Additional Adjustments

When creating plan & profile sheets for urban areas, the user may find that some routes that make a sharp 90 degree turn will run off the top and/or bottom of the plan view. If this happens, the user can expand the extent of the plan view y-axis by changing y limits in `rat_plan_profile_report_pdf.py` on line 178 (**ax_plan.set_ylim(-200, 200)**) from 200 to 400 or larger. Similarly, some routes in mountainous locations may run off the top and/or bottom of the profile view. If this happens, the user can expand the extent of the profile view y-axis by changing the y limits in `rat_plan_profile_report_pdf.py` on line 226 (**ax_prof.set_ylim(avg_elev - 100, avg_elev + 100)**) from 100 to 200 or larger.

## Appendix B. Quick Tuning Playbooks (Recommended)

**Playbook 1: “Too many curves statewide”**
* Increase `H_SMOOTH_FACTOR`
* Increase `H_MIN_DELTA`
* Increase `H_MIN_CURVE_LENGTH_FT`
* Revalidate on sample corridors before full rerun

**Playbook 2: “Missing curves on lower-speed networks”**
* Decrease `DENSIFY_SPACING_FT`
* Decrease `H_SMOOTH_FACTOR` (or FS-specific override)
* Decrease `H_MIN_CURVE_LENGTH_FT`
* Spot-check against known geometry

**Playbook 3: “Bridge dips in vertical/profile outputs”**
* Increase `TREND_WINDOW_FT`
* Decrease `DIP_THRESHOLD_FT` modestly
* Review `BRIDGE_MAX_LEN_FT`
* Re-run targeted bridge corridors and inspect profiles
